    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "*Field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed*\n",
    "\n",
    "*A computer program is said to learn from Experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E*\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include an internet search engine or an email spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can be split into two key categories: *Supervised* and *Unsupervised* learning. Other labels exist, such as semi-supervised or Reinforcement Learning, but in this course the focus will be on Supervised and Unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "A supervised learning problem involves training a model based on a collection of *labelled* historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning tends to be a *classification* or a *regression* problem. Classification problems involve categorising data points into one of a number of possible *discrete categories*. Regression problems involve fitting a function to a set of data to accurately predict a *continous valued output*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data points are described by a set of *features*. Generally the objective of a classification machine learning algorithm is to utilise the features to create sub-spaces of the feature space that belong to a single class. For regression problems, the features are used as inputs to a function that can be used to estimate the value of an unknown feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning doesn't have the luxury of a set of data with accurate labels, and only has the raw data to work with. These techniques therefore tend to find a solution that maximises a separation of the data set, utilising a discovered structure within the data. *Clustering* techniques are a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
